# server-metrics-system
A server metrics system with built-in AI-powered features, developed during my internship at Mountech for Leadgenâ€™s server monitoring and performance analysis.
** This System monitors all the active and inactive services on the server**

### On the dashboard one can check all their system services and search through them based on various parameters

### In the Logs Sections, Users can select and cycle through different service's indivisual logs. These Logs are parsed and presented in a readable format.

### Once the logs are fetched, i have assigned an ai agent "ASK Hanan" to read through these hundreds of lines of logs and provide a summary, errros if any found and their counter measures.

### This way any non-technical person will also be able to go through their server and its services without needing much technical knowledge.
